        <p> My name is Andrea Pünchera, I grew up in Switzerland and used to ski
            race professionally until the age of 22.</p>
        <p> After that, I studied Finance and Banking and started my career with EY 
            in Transaction Advisory working on M&A deals doing Financial
            Due Diligence and Valuation and Business Modelling Projects.
            I then moved on to Strategy within EY-Parthenon and for the past
            3.5 years helped build a Swiss Fintech in Zurich.</p>

        <p> I'm Passionate about Entrepreneurship, Technology, Sports, 
            Social Impact, and Venture Capital.</p>
